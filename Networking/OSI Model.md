# OSI Model

## Theory
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model explains how data
travels from one system to another using 7 layers.

## OSI Layers
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## Basic Practical
Command:
ping google.com

Observation:
- Ping fails → Network layer issue
- Website not opening but ping works → Application layer issue

## SOC Perspective
SOC analysts use the OSI model to identify
at which layer a network issue or attack occurs.
