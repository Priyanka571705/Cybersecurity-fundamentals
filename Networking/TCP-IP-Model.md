# TCP/IP Model

## Theory
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model
explains how data is transmitted over the internet.
It is the practical model used in real-world networking.

## TCP/IP Layers
1. Network Interface
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

## OSI vs TCP/IP (Quick View)
- OSI → Conceptual model (7 layers)
- TCP/IP → Practical model (4 layers)

## Basic Practical
Command:
ipconfig        (Windows)
ifconfig / ip a (Linux)

Observation:
- Shows IP address, subnet mask, and network interface details

## SOC Perspective
SOC analysts use the TCP/IP model to understand
how network traffic flows and to analyze
suspicious connections, packet captures, and alerts.
