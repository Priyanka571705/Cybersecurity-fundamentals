# CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

## Introduction
The CIA Triad is a fundamental security model used to guide
information security policies and practices.
It is extremely important for SOC analysts to understand this model.

## Confidentiality

### What is Confidentiality?
Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible
only to authorized users.

### Examples
- Password protection
- Encryption
- Access control

### SOC Perspective
SOC analysts monitor:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data leakage incidents
- Suspicious login activity

---

## Integrity

### What is Integrity?
Integrity ensures that data is accurate and has not been
modified without authorization.

### Examples
- File hash verification
- Digital signatures
- Change monitoring

### SOC Perspective
SOC analysts detect:
- Unauthorized file changes
- Malware altering system files
- Suspicious data modifications

---

## Availability

### What is Availability?
Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible
to authorized users when needed.

### Examples
- System uptime
- Backups
- DDoS protection

### SOC Perspective
SOC analysts respond to:
- Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Server downtime alerts
- Resource exhaustion issues
